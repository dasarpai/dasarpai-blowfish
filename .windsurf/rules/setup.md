- I am using hugo project's blowfish theme. 
- It has config\_default folder and all the settings are available there.
- If some modification need to be done then don't update the theme folder files but create a copy of that in layouts folder and update that.
- Please don't create any config.yaml file. Update config\_default\hogo.toml file. Remember this for all future tasks as well.
