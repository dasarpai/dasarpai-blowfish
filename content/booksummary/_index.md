# Welcome to Book/Interview/Documentary/Movie summary blog! 

I've always believed that books are the best way to learn new things and expand your horizons. This blog is a collection of summaries of books that I've found particularly interesting and useful. I hope you find something here that inspires you to read more. I also have added summary of documentaries, movies and interviews with Technocrats, Innovators and Entrepreneurs.
